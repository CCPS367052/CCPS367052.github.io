          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am and have been working toward graduating at Naples High School, and am working to eventually move into my own apartment while I'm a college student.

            To work toward these goals, I'm keeping a good GPA and getting all my credits so I can pass and move onto college and am saving up money for my tuition by working a job at Dunkin Donuts. When I have graduated from high school, I will start a higher paying job as a food runner/host with my two brothers at the Bellasara, a high end hotel bar & cafe in the financial district of Naples, Florida.

            In 2012, I began my school career with scholastic Books. I most valued the companyâ€™s collaborative work environment and its commitment to publishing diverse writers. I believe that my time at Osceola was crucial in developing the ethics I practice in my career today.

            Some of my short-term goals are to learn Spanish, improve my overall academic performance, and to start working on my degree requirements. I will accomplish these goals by managing my time within my schedule and making use of class time and tools wisely.  

            When not studying or working, I like to spend my time at the skatepark stacking clips with the boys, I also like to listen to and play music on my guitar.
