          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>1. I am and have been working toward graduating at Naples High School, and am working to eventually move into my own apartment while I'm a college student.

2. To work toward these goals, I'm keeping a good GPA and getting all my credits so I can pass and move onto college, and am saving up money for my tuition by working a job at Dunkin Donuts. When I have graduated from high school, I will start a higher paying job as a food runner/host with my two brothers at the Bellasara, a high end hotel bar & cafe in the financial district of Naples, Florida.

3. In 2012, Peyton began his school career with scholastic Books. He most valued the companyâ€™s collaborative work environment and its commitment to publishing diverse writers. Peyton believes that his time at Osceola was crucial in developing the ethics he practices in his career today.

4.  Some of my short term goals are to learn Spanish, improve my overall academic performance, and to start working on my degree requirements. I will accomplish these goals by managing my time within my schedule and making use of class time and tools wisely.  

5. When not studying or working, I like to spend my time at the skatepark stacking clips with the boys, I also like to listen to and play music on my guitar.
